        <p>All group members posted a questionnaire on their Facebook-page for our aquaintances to answer. The questions are adressing the sites professionalism, how hard/easy it is to navigate on the page, and how it is to access information on the page.

      <!--6. Feedback Summary-->
      <h2>6.</h2>
        <p>
          A summary of the feedback you received organized by
          question type (design, navigation, content, usability, etc.). Highlight both positive
          comments and thoughtful criticism, your client's testimonial, etc.
        </p>
        <p>

          The survey helped us address different aspects of how the site looked and worked.

          Regarding the design, we asked the following questions in our survey:<br>
          - Which impression did you get from CeFH? With a ranging from 1-5, from "not profesional" to "professional" <br>
          <img src="img/howprofesh.png" alt="how professional"><br>
          The picture shows that 50% of the answers gave us the highest score, and no one gave us the lowest. This means that we succeeded to provide a professional website.<br><br>
          - How easy was it to read the text on the site? <br>
          <img src="img/readtext.png" alt="how to read text"><br>
          From these results, we can see that the text is quite readable. <br>

          <p>Both our client were quite happy with the design and how it looked with the colors. It was nice that it was obvious that it was their site, and not an under-site of NIPH, as it used to be. We got some comments about the pictures on the site, but they understood why we had them when we explained that they were placeholders. </p>


          <img src="img/navigation.png" alt="Navigation question"><br>
          The answers we got on how the navigation on the site worked were quite positive. The checkboxes had a ranging from 1 to 5, with a ranging from "difficult" to "easy". According to the answers, over half of the participants gave it the highest score and 1 person gave it the lowest score. With this, we can conclude that we have solved the navigation quite well. <br>
          <img src="img/findinginfo.png" alt="finding info"><br>
          We also asked the participants about how easy it was to access information about the researchers at the center, and this was also not an issue for most of the people.

          <p>In the observation from our clients it was obvious that all of them understood how to navigate trough the navbar, and all og them managed to easily access the information they were looking for.</p><br>

          Our clients thoight it the content on sites matched with their expectations, although they had some minor comments on some aspects. The obvious one is that they would want their own pictures instead of placeholders. They also wanted another order on the home page; they wanted the timeline first, then publications, then news. This was to highlight what they saw as most important to the visitors.
          They also wanted an abstract on the event-page, so that when you hover over a certain event, the visitor will get more info about what the event is about. Otherwise, they were quite content.

      <!--7. Your Response-->
      <h2>7.</h2>
        <p>
          Provide your response to the feedback. Concretely, describe what
          you could do (once the class is over) to address this feedback with changes in your
          design or implementation. You can also address why some of the raised issues or
          suggestions for improvements are difficult or impossible to tackle.

      <!--8. Self Reflection-->
      <h2>8.</h2>
        <p>
          8. Step back and reflect on the whole project experience and what you
          learned from it. Are there general lessons that you learned, beyond the
          nuts-and-bolts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? We would like you to take this
          seriously and be thoughtful about your comments, but there is no right or wrong
          answer here, so don't feel that you have to flatter us or try to divine what we want to
          hear.
