          A brief summary of the questionnaire you send out to testers, as
          well as the link to the Google Form you used. Don't forget to ask your client to test

        </p>
        <p>All group members posted a questionnaire on their Facebook-page for our aquaintances to answer. The questions are adressing the sites professionalism, how hard/easy it is to navigate on the page, and how it is to access information on the page. It also adressed the age of the test-subjects, which type of unit they tested the site on and which of the functions they tested. </p>

      <!--4. Tester Audience-->
      <h2>4.</h2>
        <p>
          To get feedback on our website, we sent out a questionnaire and conducted observations,
          which gave us valuable insight. From the questionnaire we received 62 answers, 84 %
          being from the age group 19-30, 7 % from the age group 51-65, 5 % from the age group
          65 plus, and 4 % from the age group 0-18. To get a better understanding of how the
          page worked for the target group, mainly being 30-60, we also carried out five observations.
          Three of them were scientists, two of them being from CeFH. The remaining two were made on other
          people within the target group. This gave us a more detailed feedback, as well as
          backing up the information learned from the questionnaire.

          A summary of the different platforms (devices and browsers) that

          On the survey, we got 62 participants. 5% of them used tablet, 39% used a PC or mac, and the remaining 56% used their mobile phone. Our clients used their computer, and other test results that we reached out to for the sake of our user-grups used their computer.  </p>

      <!--7. Your Response-->
      <h2>7.</h2>
        <p>
          Provide your response to the feedback. Concretely, describe what
          you could do (once the class is over) to address this feedback with changes in your
          design or implementation. You can also address why some of the raised issues or
          suggestions for improvements are difficult or impossible to tackle.

      <!--8. Self Reflection-->
      <h2>8.</h2>
        <p>
          First of all, we all agree this was a very fun project.
          It has been a cool experience for us design students to
          make something that really works, and not only mockups in
          Figma. Working together on a digital platform, GitHub,
          has also been a good learning experience. It was hard at first,
          but once we got the hang of it, there was no return. Making
          all design decisions before coding was an additional challenge,
          especially since our team consists of five design students.
          But it proved to be a smart move, preventing many discussions
          down the road. Working with CeFH and having continuous contact
          with them was a good experience too, giving us the feel of a
          real life work situation.
