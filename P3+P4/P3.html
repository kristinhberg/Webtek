      <h2>3. The Changes We Have Made</h2>
        <p>
          Originally we had planned to create 10 pages to the site, but as our student assistant thought this
          was a bit to big for the scope for this project, we decided to drop the four following pages and their
          associated CSS files:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>contact.html</li>
            <li>contact.css</li>
            <li>profilepage.html</li>
            <li>profilepage.css</li>
            <li>eventpage.html</li>
            <li>eventpage.css</li>
            <li>previousevents.html</li>
            <li>previousevents.css</li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          We decided to cut these pages because they were the least important.
          Instead of having a separate page for contact information we decided to put all contact info in the footer.
          In addition, contact information for each person is in the people page (and going to be on the profilepage).
        </p>
        <p>
          We also decided that we did not have time to make a profilepage for every single person. This is because the content
          of this page would be hard to attain for us, as our client wanted to have the CV, info and all publications
          for each person on their site. The people.html page shows an overview of each person, and each person div was intended
          to work as a link to our profilepages, but instead we have now linked them to the profilepages on the centres
          existing site.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eventpages were also cut due to the same reason as the profilepage. This was intended to be pages with
          information about every single event, and previous events. We decided that these pages weren´t that important to our project
          as of now, so therefore we did not make these.
          <br>
          <br>
          In addition to not making these four pages we also made a few changes to some of the other pages:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>homepage.html</b>
              <p>
                Firstly, we renamed the homepage.html to index.html, so that this is set as the homepage on our folk.ntnu webserver.
                In addition we decided to not go through with one of the javascript functions: the scroll.js. This function was to enable horisontal scrolling on the news articles.
                Instead we just made the four most recent news articles to be displayed constantly.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also changed the domino.js to not to work on the news article pictures, but instead the recent publications. This was purely for aesthetic reasons.
              </p>
              <p>
                After talking with our client, we also made changes after their wish so that all parts of the homepage content; news articles, events and publications,
                will work as links to each associated page. When you hover over each of these divs, they scale up by 10%.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, we also added a view more-button under the upcoming events part of the homepage,
                this was also after the wish of our client.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>people.html</b>
              <p>
                The list of contents on the left side is a bit smaller than intended, now 250x176px.
                The pictures have the same size, and is set to be three in a row on standard screens. But a change we
                made is that when the user scales up their screen they will se four pictures in a row (unless they zoom
                out to 1936px wide, where they again appear three in a row).
              </p>
              <p>
                We also used the same six pictures in all groups, as placeholder images. Excpet from the first three pictures
                all people on our page also link to the same page of the old CeFh site (Øystein Kravdals personal information page).
                This is because it would be much too time consuming to link them to the correct page. We also see that our
                design is still clear even though the pictures are the same.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>publications.html</b>
              <p>
                The only change we made to this page is that the checkboxes are now rendered as the default checkboxes. They were initially thought to be grey, even though they are checked, but
                we decided that they work just as well with the default settings, without disturbing the design of the
                rest of the page.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>events.html</b>
              <p>
                A change we made to the event page was that we took away the filter function, this was merely because
                we did not see the need for this function, as events mostly consist of seminars. If the user want to
                navigate easier through months they can use the collapsible function to open and close each months content.
              </p>
              <p>
                And if the user wants to view events from previous years they can visit the the page for previous events.
                Compared to the publications-page and news-page, where you can filter the page by year, we wanted to make
                a sepearte site for years on the event page, because the demand for seeing events from previous years
                are not as important for the user. Events is a page for more recent things, and the demand for seeing previous
                events is not as big as it is for seeing previous news and publications (according to our client).
                We did not make the previousevents-page in this course, but the link now sends you to CeFHs old page.
                The link for view previous events now replaces the filter function on the left side.
              </p>
              <p>
                As mentioned we also removed the eventpage.html, so now each event is not linking to anything.
                If the scope of the project was bigger we would have implemented this page, but we did not do this now.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>news.html</b>
              <p>
                The news page is also pretty much the same as intended from P2, but we moved the function for filtering years from
                being above the content. We moved it to the left hand side, similar to the layout on the publications page.
                We also removed the links to events and publications that also were placed under the search bar.
                We did not see the need for these, as you can easily navigate to these pages from the navbar.
                As well we used a different placeholder picture, just for aesthetic reasons.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>news.html</b>
              <p>
                The news page is also pretty much the same as intended from P2, but we moved the function for filtering years from
                being above the content. We moved it to the left hand side, similar to the layout on the publications page.
                We also removed the links to events and publications that also were placed under the search bar.
                We did not see the need for these, as you can easily navigate to these pages from the navbar.
                As well we used a different placeholder picture, just for aesthetic reasons.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>
            In terms of changes to intended CSS styling, we have pretty much sticked to our P2 delivery, with a couple of exceptions: 
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li> When the browser width is under 960px, the navbar turns in to a hamburger menu. In addition, the CeFH-logo text disappears, only leaving the CeFH-icon.</li>
              <li> We have removed the green line from the footer.</li>
                <li>Some of the fonts have been adjusted in size.</li>
            </ul>
          <br>
          <p>We also changed some of our javascript functions.</p>
          <p>As mentioned, we did not make the newsscrolling.js function. We also did not make the filter.js function</p>
          <p>Instead we fulfilled the minimum requirements in this way:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>domino.js:</b>Kristin implemented a Javascript function that made the recent publication divs on the
              homepage appear one after another when first entering the page and after scrolling down to the right position.
              This was done using a javascript funciton combined with css keyframes animation.
            </li>
            <li><b>table.js:</b>Kari implemented a Javascript funciton on the publications-page and news-page that allows the
              user to choose between different categories in the filter menu (should have probably be called filter.js now looking
              back on it).
            </li>
            <li><b>header+footer.js:</b>Kristin and Kari implempted a javascript function that makes the header and
              footer modular.
            </li>
            <li><b>responsivenavbar.js:</b>Kristin implemented a function to make the navbar responsive on screens smaller than
              964px wide. This makes the navbar menu into a clickable dropdown menu.
            </li>
            <li><b>collapsible.js:</b>Emil and Oda implemented a function to hide and show the content according to months
              on the newspage and eventspage.
            </li>
            <li><b>search.js:</b> Kari implemeted a function so that the user can type something into the search bar
              and it will be sent to the console log and reset.
            </li>
          </ul>
          This was done using a javascript funciton combined with css keyframes animation</li>
        <li><b>table.js:</b>Kari implemented a Javascript funciton on the publications-page and news-page that allows the
          user to choose between different categories in the filter menu (should have probably be called filter.js now looking
          back on it).</li>
