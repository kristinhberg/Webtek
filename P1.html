    <h2>Our client: Center for Fertility and Health</h2>
    <h3>Contant person: Siri Håberg, deputy director</h3>
    <p>Our client is the Center for Fertility and Health, a Norwegian Centre of Excellence. They are doing research on health implications
    of changes in patterns of fertility and family structure. Today their website is just a part of the Norwegian Institue of Public Health webiste.
    They now want their own website, as a way to seperate their work from NIPH. They want us to create a webpage called "Centre of Fertility and Health".</p>

  <div class="box">
    <h2>Final location</h2>
    <p>The final location of the site is still unknown, as our client is yet to obtain this information. We are not sure if they want to
    publish their site at the NTNU server or their own.</p>
