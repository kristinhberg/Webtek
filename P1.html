      <h2>purpose and goals</h2>
        <p>The site's purpose and goals and how they will be accomplished by the site. Try to draw a connection between the goals and specific content elements of the site.</p>
        <p>They want to use the site as a way to publish their works and research articles, so that other researchers can find them and read them. So our goal is to create a straightforward and easy way to find publications by the center. The center publishes about 1-2. publications every week, and they want the newest and significant publications to appear somewhere; e.g. a front page, and stay there for a week or so. The rest of the publications of the center should lie in an underlying page. In addition, they want to show an overview of the people working at the centre, with their CVs and publications.</p> 
        <p>Another goal is to use the site to promote themselves and their work, so that they can continue gaining money through sponsors. Therefore it is important for them to front themselves as a Center of Excellence (sff), as this suggests their importance.</p>
        <p>Another purpose is to show upcoming events happening at the center; e.g. meetings and famous guests visiting. They want to show this through a type of calendar or timeline, that shows future but also the past.</p>
