  <!--Client-->
  <div class="box">
    <h2>Administrative details</h2>
    <h4>Our client: Center for Fertility and Health</h4>
    <h4>Contant person: Siri Håberg, deputy director</h4>
    <p>Our client is the Center for Fertility and Health, a Norwegian Centre of Excellence. They are doing research on health implications
    of changes in patterns of fertility and family structure. Today their website is just a part of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health website.
    They now want their own website, as a way to separate their work from NIPH. They want us to create a webpage called "Centre of Fertility and Health".</p>
  </div>

  <!--Purpose and goals-->
  <div class='box'>
      <h2>Purpose and goals</h2>
        <p>The site's purpose and goals and how they will be accomplished by the site. Try to draw a connection between the goals and specific content elements of the site.</p>
        <p>They want to use the site as a way to publish their works and research articles, so that other researchers can find them and read them. So our goal is to create a straightforward and easy way to find publications by the center. The center publishes about 1-2. publications every week, and they want the newest and significant publications to appear somewhere; e.g. a front page, and stay there for a week or so. The rest of the publications of the center should lie in an underlying page. In addition, they want to show an overview of the people working at the centre, with their CVs and publications.</p>
        <p>Another goal is to use the site to promote themselves and their work, so that they can continue gaining money through sponsors. Therefore it is important for them to front themselves as a Center of Excellence (sff), as this suggests their importance.</p>
        <p>Another purpose is to show upcoming events happening at the center; e.g. meetings and famous guests visiting. They want to show this through a type of calendar or timeline, that shows future but also the past.</p>
  </div>

  <!--Audience-->
  <div class="box">
    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>The intended audience for the website are other scientists who want to see our clients employees and events, as well as work such as published articles. The audience may also be corporations that are considering giving CEFH financial support, and want to predict how their funds will be spent.</p>
    <p>During our meeting, the client expressed that their website today is aimed towards the “average Joe” and not the scientific community. The content and organization of the page is not sufficiently specific and provides irrelevant information. Therefore they want us to change the content and set-up so that it is more directed towards professionals. To do so we will most likely have to strip down the page to contain only relevant and essential information, articles and events, so that this will be readily available to the audience of the website.</p>
    <p>This might be a challenge for us as students, as we are unfamiliar with the scientist environment. Therefore we will have to be in close dialogue with our client to ensure correct information flow and content with our web design. The page has to appear professional and clean, without excess graphics and so.</p>
  </div>

  <!--Content of the site-->
  <div class="box">
    <h2>The content of the site and how it is organized</h2>
    <p> The site should be organized so that when you first open the page, the logo and SFF should be quite visible. There should be a menu where you can navigate between different categories like people working on this center, an about-category, publication from this center etc. On the front page there should be a short text with some general information about the center, and should also be a calendar/timeline showing upcoming and previous events, such as meetings and visitors. </p>
    <p> On the publication-category there should be a complete list of publications and accentuate the most important ones. On the people-category one can find a link to their CV, contact info and their publications. </p>
  </div>

  <!--Specific preferences-->
  <div class="box">

  </div>

  <!--Final location-->
  <div class="box">
    <h2>Final location</h2>
    <p>The final location of the site is still unknown, as our client is yet to obtain this information. We are not sure if they want to
    publish their site at the NTNU server or their own.</p>
