    <h2>Our client: Center for Fertility and Health</h2>
    <h3>Contant person: Siri Håberg, deputy director</h3>
    <p>Our client is the Center for Fertility and Health, a Norwegian Centre of Excellence. They are doing research on health implications
    of changes in patterns of fertility and family structure. Today their website is just a part of the Norwegian Institue of Public Health webiste.
    They now want their own website, as a way to seperate their work from NIPH. They want us to create a webpage called "Centre of Fertility and Health".</p>

    <h2>The content of the size and how it is organized</h2>
    <p> The site should be organized so that when you first open the page, the logo and SFF should be quite visible. There should be a menu where you can navigate between different categories like people working on this center, an about-category, publication from this center etc. On the front page there should be a short text with some general information about the center, and should also be a calendar/timeline showing upcoming and previous events, such as meetings and visitors. </p>
    <p> On the publication-category there should be a complete list of publications and accentuate the most important ones. On the people-category one can find a link to their CV, contact info and their publications. </p>

    <h2>Specific Preferences</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>CEFH would like to make their published scientific material available.</li>
      <li>CEFH would like to display their employees, their contact information, CVs and published articles.</li>
      <li>CEFH would like to share information about their upcoming and completed events.</li>
      <li>CEHF would like an overhead dropdown navigation menu.
      <li>CEFH would like us to comment what we do while writing code, so that the website may be developed further after the course.</li>
      <li>The front page of the website should clearly state who CEFH is and what they do, as well as the SFF certification.</li>
      <li>CEFH would like the website to be in english.</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>purpose and goals</h2>
        <p>The site's purpose and goals and how they will be accomplished by the site. Try to draw a connection between the goals and specific content elements of the site.</p>
        <p>They want to use the site as a way to publish their works and research articles, so that other researchers can find them and read them. So our goal is to create a straightforward and easy way to find publications by the center. The center publishes about 1-2. publications every week, and they want the newest and significant publications to appear somewhere; e.g. a front page, and stay there for a week or so. The rest of the publications of the center should lie in an underlying page. In addition, they want to show an overview of the people working at the centre, with their CVs and publications.</p>
        <p>Another goal is to use the site to promote themselves and their work, so that they can continue gaining money through sponsors. Therefore it is important for them to front themselves as a Center of Excellence (sff), as this suggests their importance.</p>
        <p>Another purpose is to show upcoming events happening at the center; e.g. meetings and famous guests visiting. They want to show this through a type of calendar or timeline, that shows future but also the past.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h2>Final location</h2>
    <p>The final location of the site is still unknown, as our client is yet to obtain this information. We are not sure if they want to
    publish their site at the NTNU server or their own.</p>
