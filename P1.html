    <h2>The content of the size and how it is organized</h2>
    <p> The site should be organized so that when you first open the page, the logo and SFF should be quite visible. There should be a menu where you can navigate between different categories like people working on this center, an about-category, publication from this center etc. On the front page there should be a short text with some general information about the center, and should also be a calendar/timeline showing upcoming and previous events, such as meetings and visitors. </p>
    <p> On the publication-category there should be a complete list of publications and accentuate the most important ones. On the people-category one can find a link to their CV, contact info and their publications. </p>
