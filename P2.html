      <h2>3. Purpose, goals and audience</h2>
        <p>
          The website is supposed to work as a platform for CEFH’s, where they can make their projects, employees, upcoming events and research articles available to other researchers. Our goal is to present this in a suitable manner, so that they can continue gaining money from sponsors and recognition from fellow researchers. The websites main audience is reserchears, as well as potential sponsors.
        </p>

<!-- Navigation Structure -->

    <div class="box">
      <h2>4. Navigation Structure</h2>
        <p>
          CeFH’s website has a navigation structure based on the hierarchy model. Every site of the website will be reachable at any time, thanks to a menu bar that will be present on every site. In addition, some of the sites will link to each other, shown specifically in Figure 1.  
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to make a flexible website that makes all the content easy accessible. That is why we include a global menu bar. To make a website that feels natural and has a good flow, we also include some links between the different pages.
        </p>

<!-- Content -->

    <div class="box">
              <h2> 6. Content </h2>
              <ol>

                <!-- Homepage -->
                <li>homepage.html</li>
                  <img class="mockup" src="./img/Homepage.jpg"/>
                  <p>
                    The first thing to appear when visiting the website is the homepage. This page will include a menubar, the CeFH-logo with some additional information, news, recently published articles, upcoming events and the footer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This page will give the user an oversight of who CeHF is and what they do. More detailed information is easily accessible, either by using the menubar, or through links from the other content further down the page. Whitespace has been important for us to include, as it makes the information easier to process for the user. To organize the content, we chose to use two different background colors. A stronger color on graphical elements was included to make the page more vibrant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Through the use of Javascript, a number of functions will be added to the homepage. One function will enable horisontal scrolling on the news articles. Another will make the pictures appear one after another when first entering the page. The third will make it so that boxes also works as links. This will work when you hover over the box, scaling it up by approximately 10%.
                  </p>
                <!-- About -->
                <li>about.html</li>
                  <img class="mockup" src="./img/about.jpg"/>
                  <p></p>
                <li>people.html</li>

                <!-- Publications -->
                <li>publications.html
                  <img class="mockup" src="./img/publications.jpg"/>
                  <p>
                    This page will contain a complete list
                    of all the publications from CEFH since it first
                    started in 2017. Right below the header there
                    is a dedicated search bar for searching through publications
                    only, this will give users easy access if they are looking
                    for specific content. Below the search bar there is a link to the "people"
                    page, if users wants to se publications from a specific person.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The publications are presented on the right
                    side of the page as a list of boxes including title, authors and date.
                    They are sorted chronolgically.
                    If you hover a box it will scale up by a little
                    to indicate that it can be pressed. On click you will be taken
                    to an external publishing site.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the left side of the page there is a contents menu that includes the years 2019-2017
                    for easy access to the desired year of publication. On hover the text will appear darker and
                    on click the user wil be scrolled down to the headline of the chosen year.
                    The menu also has four different check boxes for different types of publications;
                    scientific articles, books, book chapters and reports. When checked the text will appear darker.
                    The contents meny will be locked in position when scrolling further down the page so that
                    users at any time can manouver through the different years of publication and types of content.
                  </p>

<!-- Minimum requirements-->

  <div class="box">
    <h2>7. Minimum requirements</h2>
    <p>We plan to fulfil the minimum requirments of Javascript applications in this way:</p>
    <ul class="java">
      <li> <i><b>1.domino.js:</b></i> Kristin will be in charge of implementing a Javascript function that will make the
    pictures on the homepage and people page appear one after another when first entering the pages
    This will make the otherwise static page a bit more dynamic.</li>
    <li><i><b>2.newsscrolling.js:</b></i> Emil will be in charge of implementing a Javascript funciton that will make the
    news articles on the homepage scrollable horisontally. This is to allow the viewer to check out more news.</li>
    <li><i><b>3.contentpointer.js:</b></i> Oda will be in charge of implementing a Javascript funtion that will appear on the people page and publications page
    that makes it possible for the viewer to skip directly down to parts of the content of the page. This is so that
    they do not have to scroll through all of the content if they quickly want to find something.</li>
    <li><i><b>4.scale.js:</b></i> Kari will be in charge of implementing a Javascript funciton that appears on every page that there are boxes that also
    works as links. This will work when you hover over the box, scaling it up by approximately 10%. This will signify to the user
    that this is a link. </li></ul>

    <p> We might also add more javscript functions later if we find it suitable.<p>
